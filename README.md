# Queue Operations  

## 📌 Introduction  
A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.  
This means the element inserted first will be removed first.  

Common real-life examples:  
- People standing in a line at a ticket counter.  
- Printer job scheduling.  
- CPU task scheduling.

## ⚙️ Basic Operations of Queue  
1. **Enqueue** → Insert an element at the rear of the queue.  
2. **Dequeue** → Remove an element from the front of the queue.  
3. **Front/Peek** → Get the front element without removing it.  
4. **isEmpty** → Check whether the queue is empty.  
5. **isFull** → Check whether the queue is full (for fixed-size queue).
